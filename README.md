# WoodKG
WoodKG is a knowledge graph for African Wood charcoal studies. This repository contains the details of graph building and wood identification algorithm.
The graph is a merge of plant informations coming from: (1) Plant Of the World Online (POWO) which describe up to date taxonomic name, plants hierarchy and geolocation; (2) InsideWood wood charcoal description which use the International Association of Wood Anatomists (IAWA) features list and (3) the Southern African wood CHArcoal description using the IAWA features list.

# Requierement

All the implementation is contains in a Jupyter Notebook

# Usage

- Wood Description update

The jupyter notebook "burnwood_extract" contains all steps to extract from unstructured text in CSV columns, the familly, genus and taxa of a sample from both InsideWood and IAWA databases and match its accepted label in the POWO taxonomy. It will also translate IAWA features symbole into specific number between 0 and 3 (0 for total absence, 1 for doubtfull presence, 2 for not systematic presence and 3 for presence) and produce a CSV that will be lift into RDF graph with mapping rules. A second CSV is produce to be used for machine learning purpouse.

- Knowledge graph use case examples

The jupyter notebook "QC_sparql" contains example of possible use cases and SPARQL translation of those use cases.

- Wood Identification

The identlib.py script take a csv of wood description and give the closest spicies based on their IAWA features. The list is order by number of mismatches.
This script focus on 4 African regions to fit the initial problem and database of wood sample.

# Example of identification

"Type 7" sample of SACHA database.

| Olea |	Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata	| 7 |
